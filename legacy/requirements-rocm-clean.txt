# Purpose: Essential for base TTS function, audio processing, config, and basic language support.

# ========================================
# KEEP (Problematic - Handle Separately in Dockerfile)
# ========================================
# Purpose: Required for specific models (Transformers/XTTS, Bark) or training, but strictly depend on PyTorch.
# Risk: High risk of causing pip to install incompatible CUDA PyTorch if not handled carefully.
# Action: Install these individually in Dockerfile, often using --no-deps initially.

transformers>=4.33.0
# encodec>=0.1.1 # Needed for Bark model (Keep commented for initial build)
# trainer>=0.0.36 # Needed ONLY for training (Keep commented for initial build)

# ========================================
# REMOVE (Optional / Non-Essential / High-Risk / Language Specific)
# ========================================
# Purpose: Used for web server examples, notebooks, visualization, training plotting, heavy language tools,
#          or specific languages/extras not immediately needed.
# Risk: Ranges from low (optional) to high (spacy/thinc). Removing maximizes initial build success.
